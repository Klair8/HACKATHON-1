Space invaders game.
I really like how you write above each section of javascript what the following code does.
It is very important for readability and working with teams.
Also the styling is done well & I like the use of CSS animations!
The use of window.location.assign for getting between your html pages is a great idea & Dom manipulation done well.
Wonderful Job!
Fun game and even got rick rolled at the end.
